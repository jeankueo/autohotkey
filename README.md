# Autohotkey Script for Evernote - Color Changing

Purpose of this script is use "Win + Hotkey" to apply quick color switch. This is a very handy function for heavy note user. Here are some heads up before you use it:
* Since a lot hotkey combination with "Ctrl" is reserved and widely accepted by windows users, I choose "Win" key for it's less popular.
* This script is only applicable when a single evernote window is active. Which means it's not applicable in evernote main window. Since this script is based buttons positions on single note window, if anyone want to use it in evernote main frame, please adjust the script.

Install Steps
--------------
* Install Autohotkey from [Autohotkey website](https://autohotkey.com/)
* If you want some customized color other than predefined ones in evernote, maintain them in color pallet. In my case, besides the basic colors, I steal some color names and definitions from MAC, and defined like this
