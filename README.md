# Autohotkey Script for Evernote - Hotkeys for Font Color Change

Purpose
--------------
of this script is use "Win + Hotkey" to apply quick color switch. This is a very handy function for heavy note user. Here are some heads up before you use it:
* I use Ctrl as a combination, though this key is widely used in many aspect, but in evernote you dont really need ctrl+s to save, and I have exchanged my cap key and ctrl key. I find it easier for my hand to touch.
* When I wrote this script, I get all positions in a single note window (not in evernote main window with side bars.) So the hotkeys are only available in single note window which you can pop from evernote main frame. If you want to use it in main frame too, don't hesitate to  adjust the script.
* MAC user can use Keyboard maestor as a substitute solution.
* Version of my evernote is 6.7.5. Evernote update may possibly effect the script. Till now one problem i found is update of evernote will clean customized colors... So please keep records of color values if you are as obsessed as I do in color.
* Have fun! I actually made literal changes to my HOT keys :)

Install Steps
--------------
* Install Autohotkey from [Autohotkey website](https://autohotkey.com/)
* If you want some customized color other than predefined ones in evernote, maintain them in color pallet. In my case, besides the basic colors, I steal some color names and definitions from MAC, and defined like this

* Download file [evernote.color.ahk](./evernote.color.ahk) to your PC and double click, an instance of autohotkey will run. 
* Now you can use the hotkeys. Pop your note from evernote, focus on the single note window and do your editing. The hotkeys are provided in following combinations. First 4 are my customized colors, and the rest are basic colors provided in evernote:
  * Ctrl + w : teal
  * Ctrl + e : tangerine
  * Ctrl + a : plum
  * Ctrl + s : stawberry
  * Ctrl + d : turquoise
  * Ctrl + f : lemon
  * Ctrl + 5 : snow
