# Autohotkey Script for UK layout keyboard + DEU input method

Purpose
--------------
I have a UK layout keyboard, but I need to type typical German umlaut like üöäß. German keyboard has an extra key right to left shift key which types "><|".  To type these impossible smbols (due to this missing key), I wrote this simple script.

Install Steps
--------------
* Install Autohotkey from [Autohotkey website](https://autohotkey.com/)
* Download file [uk.keyboard.for.de.input.method.ahk](./uk.keyboard.for.de.input.method.ahk) to your PC and double click, an instance of autohotkey will run. 
* Now you can use the hotkeys. 

Key map defined in Script
--------------
win + y                    <
win + shift + y       >
win + alt                 |
