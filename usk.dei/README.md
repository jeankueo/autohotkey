# Autohotkey Script for US International layout keyboard + DEU input method

Purpose
--------------
I have a US layout keyboard, but I need to type typical German umlaut like üöäß. German keyboard has an extra key right to left shift key which types "><|".  To type these impossible smbols (due to this missing key), I wrote this simple script. See following img. White deutsch keyboard has extra key which is highlighted, and I also marked the keys on black US keyboard I used to simulate this key.
